	/// We find the mouseInWorldPosition where it intersects with the plane the player is on. Then we are only interested in the XZ plane because y is always 1
	/// Then we get the XZ plane components of character and we find distance between mouseWorldPositionXZ and CharacterPosition XZ in 2D , if this distance is smaller than our treshold
	/// that means the mouse is too closer to the character so to keep the distance we do the following:
	/// We use origin as character's xz coordinates and then find a point on them with radius = treshold+0.2 ( so a little bir farther) and thats it we put the crosshair there.
	/// There is a small gotcha that our character even if he does not have a rotation value, his barrel is rotated at 90 degrees so we are adding that to the character's Euler Angle.
